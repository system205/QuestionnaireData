The forth place is for ""quick-xml"", since Rust is created recently and such big number of days since release date is also suspicious. However, the language is promising, so the forth place.

Fuzi and xgen are both questionable because of small number of closed bug reports. It could be so due to lack discipline related to documenting bug fixes. Anyway, it seems to me that there is a better choice.
